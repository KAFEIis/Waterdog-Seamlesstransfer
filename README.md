# Waterdog-Seamlesstransfer
(First Release on the Website) A seamless cross server plugin based on Waterdogpe!

# How to install
Open the Release interface of the repository and download the built jar file.
Put the file into the plugins folder in your Waterdogpe server folder.
Finally, enjoy!

# Function and Usage
1. Cross server. The built-in cross server feature of Waterdogpe causes headaches.So we have added cross server functionality, which can be used by both players and OPs.Enter/wtgtr<server name>to cross server (you can enjoy seamless cross server)
2. Seamless cross server. Of course, if you are using other cross server plugins (such as WTransferWDPE), you can also enjoy seamless cross server functionality. However, this is experimental and not everything is possible. It is best to use our built-in cross server feature.

# About the Creator
